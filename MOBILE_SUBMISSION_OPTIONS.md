# TrustMatch App Store Submission from iPhone

## The Reality
You cannot submit iOS apps to the App Store directly from an iPhone. Apple requires:
- **macOS computer** with Xcode installed
- **Code signing** with developer certificates
- **Archive and upload** process only available on Mac

## Your Options from iPhone

### 1. **Remote Mac Services (Best Option)**
**MacinCloud** - Access a Mac from your iPhone:
- Cost: $20-30/month
- Access via Safari browser on iPhone
- Sign up: https://www.macincloud.com
- Can actually work on mobile (though challenging)

### 2. **Find a Mac Computer**
- **Apple Store**: Ask to use demo Mac briefly
- **Friends/colleagues**: Borrow a Mac for 30 minutes
- **Library/co-working space**: Many have Macs available
- **University/school**: Computer labs often have Macs

### 3. **Professional Development Service**
Hire someone to submit for you:
- **Fiverr**: iOS app submission services ($50-100)
- **Upwork**: iOS developers who can submit
- **Local developers**: Find someone nearby

### 4. **Focus on Android First**
Your TrustMatch app can be submitted to Google Play Store:
- **Android Studio**: Works on any computer
- **Easier submission process**
- **Larger market share** in many countries
